    "#### `mergeTwoLists` Method\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This method merges two sorted singly linked lists (`list1` and `list2`) into a single sorted linked list.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `list1`: The head of the first sorted linked list.\n",
    "  - `list2`: The head of the second sorted linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. **Handle Empty Lists**:\n",
    "   - `if not list1 and not list2`: If both `list1` and `list2` are empty, return `list1` (which is `None`).\n",
    "   - `if not list1 or not list2`: If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, return the non-empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Pointers**:\n",
    "   - `seek, target = (list1, list2) if list1.val < list2.val else (list2, list1)`: Initialize `seek` to point to the head of the list with the smaller first element, and `target` to point to the head of the other list.\n",
    "   - `head = seek`: Set `head` to point to the start of the merged list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge Lists**:\n",
    "   - `while seek and target`: Continue merging as long as both `seek` and `target` are not `None`.\n",
    "     - `while seek.next and seek.next.val < target.val`: Traverse the `seek` list until you find the correct position to insert the `target` node.\n",
    "       - `seek = seek.next`: Move `seek` to the next node.\n",
    "     - `seek.next, target = target, seek.next`: Insert `target` at the correct position in the `seek` list and update `target` to point to the next node.\n",
    "     - `seek = seek.next`: Move `seek` to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Head of Merged List**:\n",
    "   - `return head`: Return the head of the merged linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "- **Traversal**: Each node from both `list1` and `list2` is visited exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity is \\( O(n + m) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of nodes in `list1` and \\( m \\) is the number of nodes in `list2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "- **Extra Space**: The space complexity is \\( O(1) \\) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables (`seek`, `target`, and `head`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n + m) \\)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\)"
