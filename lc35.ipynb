    "1. **Initialize Pointers**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized.\n",
    "   - `left` starts at the beginning of the list (`0`).\n",
    "   - `right` starts at the end of the list (`len(nums) - 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Loop**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while left <= right:\n",
    "       mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `while` loop runs as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\n",
    "   - `mid` is calculated as the middle index between `left` and `right` to avoid potential overflow issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Middle Value**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "       if nums[mid] == target:\n",
    "           return mid\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the value at the `mid` index is equal to the `target`, the method returns `mid` since the target is found at this position.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjust Search Range**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "       elif nums[mid] < target:\n",
    "           left = mid + 1\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           right = mid - 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the value at `mid` is less than `target`, it means the target must be in the right half of the list. So, `left` is updated to `mid + 1`.\n",
    "   - If the value at `mid` is greater than `target`, it means the target must be in the left half of the list. So, `right` is updated to `mid - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Insertion Position**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return left\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the `target` is not found in the list, the loop exits, and the method returns `left`.\n",
    "   - `left` will be the index where the `target` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(\\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the list `nums`. This is because the binary search algorithm divides the search space in half during each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(1)\\), which means it uses a constant amount of additional space. This is because the algorithm only uses a few extra variables (`left`, `right`, and `mid`) regardless of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary search** is used to efficiently find the target or the insertion point in a sorted list.\n",
